Welcome to Map Generation! Check it out [here](WILL ADD LINK ONCE DEPLOYED).

The application generates a bunch of random biomes and offers a significant amount of control over this generation, including the noise algorithm,

![gen](img/gen.png)

navigation controls that move the minimap around,

![nav](img/nav.png)

environmental controls (weather only controls the luminosity of the map as of right now â€“ I will make it more useful once I get an idea of what I can do with it; however, the rest do cause meaningful changes in the generation of the world),

![env](img/env.png)

visualization controls to view things such as rivers, contours, caves, and erosion, 

![viz](img/viz.png)

and camera controls for the 3D generated plot that corresponds to the minimap! (I may add auto-rotate soon...)
